//CyclicBarrier is a synchronization mechanism introduced in JDK 5 in the java.util.concurrent package.
// It allows multiple threads to wait for each other at a common point (barrier) before continuing execution.
// The threads wait for each other by calling the await() method on the CyclicBarrier.
// All threads that wait for each other to reach barrier are called parties.
// You can read-up on designing and implementing a barrier for an interview question here.
//
//CyclicBarrier is initialized with an integer that denotes the number of threads that need to call the await() method on the barrier.
// Second argument in CyclicBarrierâ€™s constructor is a Runnable instance that includes the action to be executed once the last thread arrives.
//
//The most useful property of CyclicBarrier is that it can be reset to its initial state by calling the reset() method.
// It can be reused after all the threads have been released.
//
//Lets take an example where CyclicBarrier is initialized with 3 worker threads that will have to cross the barrier.
// All the threads need to call the await() method. Once all the threads have reached the barrier,
//it gets broken and each thread starts its execution from that point onwards.
